## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who Am I?
A graduate student in Western University's MDA Program, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Statistical Modeling.

## I'm currently learning:
Statistical Modeling, Power BI, Microsoft Azure, Game Development in Unity & Godot

## Past Projects:
### EpiBERT (With Prof. Yue Li, McGill University)
- A BERT-based LLM trained for classifying and assigning appropriate NPI labels to COVID-19 related medical news articles.
- Base model: BERT trained on Wikipedia corpus + AYLIEN COVID-19 dataset
- Comparison models: BERT trained on Wikipedia corpus only; RoBERTa model trained on Wikipedia corpus + AYLIEN dataset
#### My Involvement: 
- Create data pre-processing and reformatting scripts to allow for compatibility and future-proofing of data used pre-training and fine-tuning
- Pre-trained and fine-tuned all models using processed dataset
- Evaluated performance metrics of fine-tuned models; highest achieved is over 85%
