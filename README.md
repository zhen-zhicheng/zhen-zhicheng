## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who Am I?
A graduate student in Western University's MDA Program, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Statistical Modeling.
I love putting my skills to the test and solving technical puzzles to both solve research challenges and drive business value.


## ðŸ“š My Skills: 
- Programming Languages: Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript
- Data Science: Statistical modeling, regression, Random Forest algorithm, etc.
- Data Visualization: Power BI, Tableau
- Software Development

## ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning:
Statistical Modeling, Power BI, Microsoft Azure, Game Development in Unity & Godot

## ðŸ”­ Past Projects:
### EpiBERT (With Prof. Yue Li, McGill University)
- A BERT-based LLM trained for classifying and assigning appropriate NPI labels to COVID-19 related medical news articles.
- Base model: BERT trained on Wikipedia corpus + AYLIEN COVID-19 dataset
- Comparison models: BERT trained on Wikipedia corpus only; RoBERTa model trained on Wikipedia corpus + AYLIEN dataset
#### My Involvement: 
- Create data pre-processing and reformatting scripts to allow for compatibility and future-proofing of data used pre-training and fine-tuning
- Pre-trained and fine-tuned all models using processed dataset
- Evaluated performance metrics of fine-tuned models; highest achieved is over 85%
